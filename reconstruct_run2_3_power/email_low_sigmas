Hi everyone,

We discussed a bit longer with Yu and Zvonimir and this is a brief 
summary -- please correct me where I misunderstood things.


What confused us was that Sigma is close to 0 for low biased halos after 
reconstruction in Fig. 8, but we now think this might be ok: 
Reconstruction might just work perfectly for these halos because there 
is not much stochasticity or scale-dependent bias. On top of that these 
halos might have unrealistically high number density in the simulations 
so that shot noise is not a limiting issue. Actual observations probably 
have much lower number densities and higher shot noise, so that 
reconstruction can't be as effective in that case and we don't see 
reconstructions achieve Sigma=0 in real observations.

For higher biased halos, stochasticity kicks in and we have higher shot 
noise, so reconstruction is less effective and only gets us to Sigma=4 
or so.

 From this it seems like Fig. 8 would make sense. One way to better 
check this interpretation would be to randomly subsample the low-biased 
halos so that they all have the same number density. With this we can 
disentangle the dependence on shot noise and stochasticity in the above 
arguments (if reconstruction efficiency only depends on shot noise, then 
Sigma should not change with bias any more). So maybe that's worth checking?

It would also be useful to see Fig. 8 pre-reconstruction.


Zvonimir also suggests multiplying the rhs of Eq. 6 by (1+b*k^2) to 
improve the fit. This should cancel the C_G^2 at leading order and would 
include some other magic that I didn't completely follow ;)

Best,
Marcel

As Hee-Jong pointed out the propagator or cross-correlation coefficient 
with initial conditions would of course be a much more stringent test if 
reconstruction really works perfectly for the low-biased halo samples 
(although I'm not sure how to do this with halos?).

Best,
Marcel

I see. But then, is there a reason for this scenario to work better
than the subsampled dm, because we see Sigmas for dm is above Sigmas
for low bias case?
I think that the subsampled dm has a smaller relative shot noise than
low bias halos.
Would dm have more stochasticity than low-bias halos centers?

Well, but I thought that velocities (displacements) for dm are much more nonlinear 
than for any halos (for which linear displacement dispersion is a fairly good approximation). 
That is why I would then think reconstruction does much less of a perfect job for DM 
which then gives residual \sigma signal in the fit. 
Does this make sense?

Disentangling stochasticity and shot noise effect on Sigmas sounds
interesting. Yes, we will check it.

Maye actually, the residual sigma signal in the case of high bias halos
is due to the scale dependent bias rather than the stochasticity.
As Hee-Jong mentioned in eq 6 stochasticity would cancel
but scale dependent bias would still multiply the residual wiggle spectra.
As you say, subsampling might clarify this.
 
>> It would also be useful to see Fig. 8 pre-reconstruction.
Ok.

You mean it will remove any scale-dependent bias effect on the damping factor?

Yes, it is just the scale dependent bias peace, which is more relevant for massive halos  
and which would also cancel in the broad band but it would still show up in just the wiggle part as well. 
And right, it would take over at first order the current sigma effect, if one fits for "b".
Hopefully one would then not need C_G^2 (since reconstruction should, I'd assume, 
work well for halos, especially massive ones).
What do you think?

Zvonimir

thinking about it, it might be quite useful to compare Fig 8 pre-reconstruction 
and post-reconstruction. 
In both cases, I think the analogous formula to eq 6 should work, something like

\hat P_\wig - \hat P_\now = b^2 (1 + b_scale k^2 ) G^2 (P_lin - P_sm) C_G^2

where b and b_scale are bias parameters and the difference of pre- and post-reconstruction
should only be in C_G^2, where:

pre-reconstruction  C_G^2 = exp[ - k^2 G^2 \sigma^2 ], where it should be that \sigma^2 ~ 30 [Mps/h]^2
post-reconstruction  C_G^2 = 1

If the picture is consistent, fits for b and b_scale in both pre and post-reconstruction cases should be similar. 
Although, higher nonlinearities might at some point ruin this picture,
or reconstruction could effect b_scale to some extent, I don't know.... but might be interesting to see.

08/02/2016:
Thank you all for the skype calls!

So, this is my summary of the current to-dos.

1. Yu, please check the status of the simulations and send us a set
with initial conditions. Sorry for pestering you.
I am sure that you will be quickly swamped by other urgent tasks, so
please let me know a rough estimate of the days needed to send us, so
that I can send you a reminder email (i.e., 'a bugging email') after
that. :)


2. For the differences in Sigmas before and after subtracting shot
noise, I am still very puzzled by this.
I am personally pursuing this at least to understand exactly what
causes the difference. Again, averaging (over 20 sets) after division
after averaging (kbin) may have something to do with it.

3. For the reason, I feel more inclined to use \hat P_\wig - \hat
P_\now which is probably more stable against the averaging and sample
variance cancelation permutations.
So, we want Figure 8 pre and post reconstruction figures. Jerry, could
you please produce this?
We will also try to generate a proper way to plot signal to noise of
\hat P_\wig - \hat P_\now.
My suggestion is "sigma{(\hat P_\wig - \hat P_\now)/b^2G^2Psm+1}".

4. For eq (6), we want (1+b k^2) as a multiplication factor based on
Zvonimir and Marcel's suggestion. I agree that post-reconstruction can
give C_G^2=1.
Thinking back the propagators post-reconstruction, they were deviation
from the Gaussian shape, especially giving ~1 near small k compared to
Gaussian.
Since we have a very small noise, this deviation may be more visible?
Also Zvonimir thinks that it is possible that dm reconstruction can be
worse than low bias case due to the nonlinearities in the velocity
field (indeed, we are only taking the centers of halos for these halo
catalogs).

5. As a function of bias, we believe that the reconstruction will be
less effective for high mass halos, partially due to stochasticity and
shot noise. Marcel suggested to setting the shot noise the same to
separate the shot noise effect, which we certainly should try.
Zvominir thinks that it will be mainly due to the scale dependent bias
once we adopt eq (6), which will be tested in #4.

please let me know if I missed something else.

From Florian,
Hi Jerry
Thanks for sending the pdf. Would you mind writing a paragraph or two about (1) What exactly you were testing, (2) what you expected from this test and (3) what your results imply for the next steps of your analysis. I think this would be very helpful for all of us.
thanks a lot Jerry

From Zvonimir
Hi Jerry and all,

thanks for the notes, it is becoming quite exciting :-) !

I have a couple of questions/thoughts to ask/share;

- I'm a bit confused about the meaning of \alphas, I guess 
I don't understand how does model eq (1) depend on it.
Could you quickly define/explain it somewhere?

- my understanding is that all the plots are in real space; 
so wouldn't it be opportune to put the constraints so that 
\Sigma_z = \Sigma_xy and similar for \alphas?

For both \Sigmas it is kind of nice that they look very similar 
in all cases, as we would expect. 
But still, my concern is that since these differences, although tiny, 
appear in the exponent, and so might, in effect, 'bias' the rest 
of the constraints. 
Why not just simply use C_G = Exp[ - k^2 \Sigma^2 / 2]? 
(but then again I don't know how \mu is beeing handled in the fit... )

- Fig 2 and 4 suggest that in model 3 there is some degeneracy 
between the fits for \Sigma and b_scale since at leading scale 
dependence they both give ~ (1 + ( - \sigma^2/2 + b_scale) k^2 ).
This suggests that one could not fit robustly for both \sigma^2 and b_scale 
at the same time, and so I'd suspect that's why there is these 'noisy' 
compared to model 2 and 1. Does this make sense to you?

On the other hand, we have good reason (from linear theory) to expect that 
\Sigma^2/2 ~ G^2 30 (Mpc/h)^2 (pre-reconstructed), so maybe it would make 
sense to have model 3 such that one fixes \sigma^2/2 and then fits for b_scale.
Similar, \Sigma^2/2 value for the post-reconstructed case should be much smaller, 
almost zero but perhaps now quite (as these plots suggest), 
I'm not sure what exactly, maybe ~ G^2 5 or 6 (Mpc/h)^2.

- Could we have somewhere the values of the growth rate G for these 
three redshifts so that we might see if some of this parameters (like b_scale 
or \Sigmas) scale as some power of G?

-  I find a very interesting part of Fig 4 the top right panel; scaling seems to be
very consistent qualitatively with what we would expect; 
only slightly annoying bit is the relatively strong redshift dependence. 
It would be very interesting to see if one could reduce this dependence (i.e. make the 
b_scale lines on top of each other) with using some small and constant \Sigma 
-- this is then similar to the earlier comment.

- last but not least; what should I conclude from the subsample results? 
Does this convince us that we can neglect the stochastic part in this difference statistic? 
--  Figure 3 would suggest so, at least for the constant stochastic peace,
(what about the top left panel? -- there is some scatter in this panel, but nowhere else)

I guess there is only one mass bin for which you plot these subsamples?
If above is true (that stochasticity has been mostly cancelled) it might be 
quite instructive to check if the same thing happens for the higher bias cases 
-- where we would expect statistic effects to be increasingly more relevant.

What do you guys think?!
Best,
Zvonimir

From Yu,
Hi,

Finally!

Here are two folders:

/global/project/projectdirs/cosmosim/lbl/yfeng1/baoshift/run4/00000400-
10/IC/LinearDensity

and 

/global/project/projectdirs/cosmosim/lbl/yfeng1/baoshift/run4/00000400-
10/fpm_1.0000/DensityFOFAll

Each contains four files numbered 000000, 000001, ....

You can read them in one after another as single precision floating point numbers, and end up having 256*256*256 numbers. Then you can treat them as a 256x256x256 array.

The normalization may be different in two cases. You can simply renormalize them. 

Could you see if you can drive your propagator code with this? do you also want the DM on a low res grid?

After the fixes are merged to the default nbodykit on NERSC, I can hand over the scripts for you or Jerry to run them at any resolution you like.

Best,

- Yu

08/20/2016
Hi, 

I didn't understand what you mean by 'zeros'.
We want two alphas are the same within statistical errors and two
Sigmas are the same within the statistical errors.
I think that this is not any more than checking if the code is doing
something expected.
(e.g., If we have a limited mesh resolution, aliasing effect will be
angle-dependent in this cubic space and we could get an artificial
angle dependence on small scales even in real space. Obviously, for
Yu's simulations, we have enough mesh resolution so that we don't need
to worry about this.)
But we don't expect any of these to be zero, right?
Sigmas won't be zero at low redshift.
I must be missing something here.

Ah yes, sorry! I was too vague here (it even took me a minute to figure out what I was trying to say)!
I guess I was just referring to the plots of \alphas in Jerrys notes, which we would like to be zero (since 
one is beeing subtracted) in the ideal case. 
And yes, sigmas I mentioned as a similar case, but we would not expect them to be zero (even for the 
reconstructed case I kind of like that your fits give small but nonzero values)!
I think I'm on the same page now here, thanks!
 
So, this is the reason why we don't need to introduce the same damping 
factor for the no-wiggle case?

In the no-wiggle case, the IR resummation is a 'redundant operation', i.e. 
the regular PT captures then the most of the IR modes. It is only once some 
localised feature appears (that, when it evolves, in PT has to be described with the 
derivative expansion) on the large scales that it makes sense to do the IR resummation. 
For example, if one would take the full (opposed to the approximated that we are useing) 
IR resummation formalism, as described in e.g. 1404.5954 (or appendix 1506.05264), 
and still perform the IR resummation only on the no-wiggle power spectrum one would 
just get back the same no-wiggle power spectrum.
That is because the IR resummation procedure in this full formalism corresponds to convolving 
our corresponding linear correlations function (with no BAO bump) with some kernel/filter that 
depends on the displacements coming from long modes only, and so if one does not have 
a feature where the BAO peak should be this kernel basically does nothing since 
it runs over a very slowly varying (compared to the kernel scale) function.
 
It seems that this is consistent with Eisenstein et al. 2007?
I agree with your estimation.

O, I see, I should also check this out! Embarrassingly, I was not aware of this.
 
I guess that we have two options:
1.  fit for Sigma using DM and then fit for b_scale for the biased case?
2. Or as you said,  just fix Sigma based on the theory and fit for the b_scale.

A yes, makes sense!
One option (version of 2) would also to be to fix Sigma to a constant 
but to vary this constant then slowly and refit each time to see if one 
could get a value for which b_scale would be only a function of b_0 
and not on redshift explicitly, i.e. get the tree redshift curves in plot 4 to overlap.

I think that Jerry plans to test subsampled biased cases as well. We
can doublecheck once it is done.

Yea, it would be great to see how this works out for halos!
 
In redshift space, we expect (1+beta*mu^2(1-S(k)) factor multiplied to 
the propagator due the reconstruction operation we do.
I have been thinking whether or not we have to include this factor
only for Pwiggleonly or both Pwiggle and Pnowiggle.
In terms of this term affecting the amplitude of the redshift-space power, 
we had better to include this both for Pwiggle and Pnowiggle so that
the net effect will cancel out for Pwiggleonly. But then, this term
shows up in the propagator calculation so that Pwiggleonly may be
affected by (1+beta*mu^2(1-S(k))* Exp[-kxy^2 \sigmaxy/2^2-kz^2 \sigmaz/2^2] rather
than Exp[-kxy^2 \sigmaxy/2^2-kz^2 \sigmaz/2^2] alone.
What is your thought? It may depend on if (1+beta*mu^2(1-S(k))
corresponds to IR contribution or not?

Ok frankly I'd need to think a bit what happens in redshift space,
but given the simplicity of our model currently, it shouldn't be too hard.
Naively I'd expect that whatever operation (like IR resummation or 
reconstruction) we do on P_wiggle we need to do also on 
P_nowiggle, although for the latter it might be redundant, and then look at the difference of this. 
The question if the scale dependent bias shows up in higher 
Keiser terms is very interesting, somehow I'd expect that it should, 
but I cant really justify this yet.
Of course, if we have the scale-dependent bias in momentum (velocity) 
field, then yes. I guess you guys are in a good position to test this 
(assuming we would be able to handle the FoG)!

If I'd have to pull a model out of the hat, I'd do something like:

P_wiggleonly[RSD] / P_wiggleonly = 
            b0^2 (1 + b_scale0 k^2/k_L^2 ) Exp[- k^2 \Sigma_0/2]
+  f b0\mu^2 (1 + b_scale2 k^2/k_L^2 ) Exp[- k^2 \Sigma_2/2]
+  f^2 \mu^4 (1 + b_scale4 k^2/k_L^2 ) Exp[- k^2 \Sigma_4/2] + O(\mu^6)
(note that this is really without any pencil work.. so might be quite off)

where now b_scale2 and b_scale4 might be suppressed but maybe not, not sure, interesting to see what happens.
Depending also I guess how we interpret FoG effects here,
we might be able to say something about the relation of \Sigma_2 and \Sigma_4.
Doing some resummtions in \mu^n it looks a bit similar to what you write above.

Ill try to play a bit to look at this how earlier model extends to the rsd 
so we can crosscheck the models we come up with.

Best,
Zvonimir

08/25/2016
Hi,
sorry for a slow response. 

Thanks for the new plots Jerry, results look very nice! 
Things are moving towards the direction we were expecting! :-)
Below are couple of more comments:

Pre-reconstructed case:

Fixed sigma plots are cool!
It is very nice to see also that the best sigma for z=0.0 is ~ 7.8 
exactly what one would get from the formula we have discussed above
\Sigma_Theory^2/2 = 1/3 \int d^3 q P_lin/q^2 (1 - j_0[ R_bao * q] ) ~ 30 (Mpc/h)^2 
for z=0, and for R_bao = 110 [Mpc/h], and 
the prediction is much worse if you just use the linear value for sigma!
This formula should be ok for all redshifts, so given your numbers 
I would just use for \Sigmas numbers from the formula above:
{7.836, 5.748, 4.773}, for z=0,0.5 and 1 respectively
and see how these affects b_scale, 
I'd expect we could get even better scale dependence. 

Also, one nontrivial thing (which I'm very happy to see!) is that 
b_scale values here are of order O(1) and not 10 or higher,
which tells us that the PT (Taylor) expansion in b_scale 
makes kind of sense, i.e. we are being self-consistent!

But also, \alpha in Fig 2 for z=0 seems much more prominent than 
for the other two redshifts.
I'm wondering if this could affect somehow the strange bump (at b1~1.5) 
we are seeing in b_scale for the z=0 black line.
Could you remake these plots by imposing \alpha to be one in all cases?
It would be very interesting to see how/if it affects fits for other parameters (b_scale)
(you guys might already know this though).

Post-reconstructed case:

So I think we can do a very similar analysis as for the pre-reconstructed case. 
We just need to figure out what the right \Sigma should be in this case... 
having in mind formula above and taking into account the reconstruction. 
But this now depends on the details of the reconstruction.
Could you guys tell us how exactly do you do the reconstruction 
(is it the same as in Marcel+++ paper)?
Are you using the final halo field and some smoothing on top of it? 

For example, if the unsmoothed linear field would have been used for the 
reconstruction (this would be some inverse Zel'dovich case), I believe that 
a good estimate for the Sigma reconstructed, in this case, would be;
\Sigma_rec = {2.84, 2.09, 1.73} for z=0,0.5 and 1 respectively.
These values have been obtained from: 
\Sigma_rec^2 = \Sigma_Linear^2 -  \Sigma_Theory^2
where  \Sigma_Theory is the formula from above, and \Sigma_Linear 
is used here since this is the value for the displacement dispersion in Zel'dovich case.
These are quite smaller than what you are currently using I believe, and if some 
smoothing for the reconstruction field is used, these numbers should be even smaller.

Using smaller values for \Sigma_rec seems good direction again since I think this would 
reduce the b_scale in the reconstructed case compared to the current values (I say this 
since b_scale now gives mostly large (some of O(10)) positive numbers, and previously in 
the case when a model with \Sigma=0 was used, it gave very negative values). 
Ideally, I'd say that reconstruction should not affect the b_scale too much (what 
to you think Hee-Jong?), and so we should expect the b_scale plots to look quite similar 
in both pre- and post-reconstructed case.
If this happens I believe we have a very strong confirmation of the physical 
picture here, which I find quite exciting! :-)

Might be good to set \alpha to one here also, just in case (it can be released later on)!

Let me know what do you think. 
Im quite excited to see how it works out!

P.S. @Hee-Jong: yes, in the earlier email, when discussing the RSD 
model it was all for the pre-reconstructed case. But as in real space, 
if we can expect that the bias_scale does not change much in reconstruction 
the model would take the same form, I think. Just the meaning (value) of \Sigmas 
should be reinterpreted/changed.
Or do we expect some qualitative difference here, that Im missing, when moving to redshift space?

Best,
Zvonimir


08/29/2016
Jerry,

Figure 2 look suspiciously similar to the bottom panel of Figure 3.
You fix alphas=1 which are many sigmas away from the best fit alphas
(especially for the left panel), but your bscale and b0 didn't
change...
Can you please doublecheck? It maybe that they have no cross-correlations.
Can you plot an alphas vs bscale scatter plot to confirm that there is
no cross correlations?

Also in the beginning of the note, please put short sentences
1. what you tested
2. What result we (Zvonimir) expect
3 what we got.

Hee-Jong
