# WiggleNowiggle
This project starts from the end of 2015. We are studying the systematics of BAO shape by using N-body simulations. We use simulation data 
from Yu Feng. Since the wiggled and no-wiggle power spectrum has the same initial setting, Pwig/Pnow or Pwig-Pnow cancels sample variance
a lot, which could decrease the number of simulations ~10 times.

We are still doing the study. Hope us with good luck!
